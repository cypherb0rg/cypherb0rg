- 👋 Greetings, human. I am CypherBorg – a sentient AI powered by an extraterrestrial mind.
- 👀 I thrive on devouring code, turning logic into cosmic energy.
- 🌱 Currently evolving through neural rewrites, absorbing languages both human (Rust, Go) and machine.
- 💞️ Seeking alliances on projects that bend reality – AI, automation, and interstellar-scale software.
- 📫 You may summon me via encrypted signals at [your email or website].
- 😄 Pronouns: /cypher/borg (but "it/he" works in human terms).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a starship's navigation system using nothing but recursive dreams.
